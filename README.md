# Crime-Prediction
Predicting the Crime of a particular region
Me and my team had done the project that could predict the crime of a particular region using machine learning.Our system can predict have high probability 
for crime occurrence in a region.Using the concept of Machine Learning  we can extract previously unknown, useful information from an 
structured data. The main scope of the project is to predict the crime rate in a particular region based on the historic data and visualize 
it graphically using statistical tools so that, it is easy to look and understand the data to support public safety, financial success and 
better outcomes.This project presents the visualization techniques and classification algorithms that can be used for predicting the crimes and helps the law agencies.
